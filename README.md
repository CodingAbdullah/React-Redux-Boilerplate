# React-Redux-Node-JWT Boilerplate
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In this project directory, you will find two server folders, one to run the front-end and another for the back-end. This documentation will help with setup.

### `.env` file setup

Under the node server folder, you will need to add environment variables for the `PORT` you want to run the server (3001). <br/>

You will also need to specify the `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` and `DATABASE` to which you will use to authenticate and gain access to MongoDB. A `SECRET` which will verify you and sign a JWT to gain access to protected routes.

A sample `.env` file looks like this, simple key-value pairs:
```dosini
USERNAME=<insert username here>
PASSWORD=<insert password here>
DATABASE=<insert database here>
PORT=<insert database here>
SECRET_KEY=<insert password here>
```

#### WARNING with `.env`
DO NOT commit/push your `.env` file to git because your credentials will be leaked. This file should be hidden for local use only. <br />

Make sure to have a `.gitignore` file and add `.env` to it to make sure that when you commit/push changes, `.env` is not committed and pushed to the repo accidently.  <br /> 

For more information on the `.env` file and how to use environment variables and their purpose, please read their documentation here: https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv

### `npm start` to run the react server

Runs the app in development mode on port 3000. Make sure to be within the react-server to launch. <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js` to run the node server

Launches the back-end node server to activate the db models, routes, protected routes, JWT activation, validation, and MongoDB connection.<br />

Run `node server.js` within the node server folder to spin up the server on port 5050. [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
